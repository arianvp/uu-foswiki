---++ Introduction

This is a generic programming library based on type classes and type families
first described by Chakravarty et al. (see http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/project/generics/).
The current release is a simplified version mostly to support a [[GuardedRewriting][rewriting library]].

---++ Download

_If you have [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install][cabal-install]]_, you should use that to install the package,
because it will handle everything for you:

<pre>
cabal install instant-generics
</pre>


_If you don't have cabal-install_, you must download the [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/instant-generics][instant-generics package]] from !HackageDB and install it manually. Get the =tar.gz= file and decompress it. Once downloaded, use the following commands for configuring, building, and installing the library:

<pre>
runghc Setup configure
runghc Setup build
runghc Setup install
</pre>

For more details on the general options available, refer to the [[http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/latest/doc/users-guide/][Cabal User's Guide]].
