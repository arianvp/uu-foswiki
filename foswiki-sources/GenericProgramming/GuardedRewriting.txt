---++ Introduction

This is a generic rewriting library based on type classes and type families described in the paper:
Thomas van Noort, Alexey Rodriguez Yakushev, Stefan Holdermans,
Johan Jeuring, Bastiaan Heeren, JosÃÂ© Pedro MagalhÃÂ£es.
[[http://dreixel.net/research/pdf/ladgr.pdf][A Lightweight Approach to Datatype-Generic Rewriting]].
Journal of Functional Programming, Special Issue on Generic Programming, 2010.

Note that this is NOT the same library as [[Rewriting]], as it uses a different underlying
generic programming library (InstantGenerics) and supports more datatypes
and rules with preconditions.

---++ Download

_If you have [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install][cabal-install]]_, you should use that to install the package,
because it will handle everything for you:

<pre>
cabal install guarded-rewriting
</pre>


_If you don't have cabal-install_, you must download the [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/guarded-rewriting][guarded-rewriting package]] from !HackageDB and install it manually. Get the =tar.gz= file and decompress it. Once downloaded, use the following commands for configuring, building, and installing the library:

<pre>
runghc Setup configure
runghc Setup build
runghc Setup install
</pre>

For more details on the general options available, refer to the [[http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/latest/doc/users-guide/][Cabal User's Guide]].
