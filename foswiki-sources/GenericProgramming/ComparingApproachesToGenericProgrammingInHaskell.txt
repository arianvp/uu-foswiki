Ralf Hinze, Johan Jeuring, and Andres LÃÂ¶h.  Comparing Approaches to Generic Programming in Haskell. In Roland Backhouse, Jeremy Gibbons, Ralf Hinze, and Johan Jeuring, editors, Lecture notes of the Spring School on Datatype-Generic Programming 2006, LNCS 4719, pages 72 - 149, 2007.

---++ Abstract
The last decade has seen a number of approaches to datatype-generic programming: !PolyP, Functorial ML, &#8216;Scrap Your Boilerplate&#8217;, Generic Haskell, &#8216;Generics for the Masses&#8217;, and so on. The approaches vary in sophistication and target audience: some propose full-blown programming languages, some suggest libraries, some can be seen 
as categorical programming methods. In these lecture notes we compare 
the various approaches to datatype-generic programming in Haskell. We 
introduce each approach by means of example, and we evaluate it along 
di&#64256;erent dimensions (expressivity, ease of use, and so on).
