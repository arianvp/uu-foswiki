---++ Introduction

This is a generic rewriting library described in the paper:
  Thomas van Noort, Alexey Rodriguez, Stefan Holdermans, Johan Jeuring, 
  Bastiaan Heeren. [[http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/Alexey/ALightweightApproachToDatatype-GenericRewriting][A Lightweight Approach to Datatype-Generic Rewriting.]]
  In Ralf Hinze and Don Syme, editors, Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN Workshop 
  on Generic Programming, WGP 2008, Victoria, BC, Canada, September 20, 2008, 
  pages 13&#8211;24. ACM Press, 2008.

Its underlying generic programming library is [[Regular]].

---++ Download

_If you have [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install][cabal-install]]_, you should use that to install the package,
because it will handle everything for you:

<pre>
cabal install rewriting
</pre>

_If you don't have cabal-install_, you must download the [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rewriting][rewriting package]] from !HackageDB and install it manually. Get the =tar.gz= file and decompress it.

Once downloaded, use the following commands for configuring, building, and installing the library:

<pre>
runghc Setup configure
runghc Setup build
runghc Setup install
</pre>

For more details on the general options available, refer to the [[http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/latest/doc/users-guide/][Cabal User's Guide]].

---++ Source

The source for this library can be downloaded from the [[http://subversion.tigris.org/][Subversion]] repository as follows:
